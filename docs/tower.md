# Tower

The tower is the central element of the playing field. It is used to move the comets around the playing field so every player has a chance to hit them.

## Functionality

The tower consists of a base and an arm with a comet at each end. The arm can be rotated horizontally and tilted vertically. Both motions are created with a stepper motor. The stepper motors are controlled with the Raspberry Pi using a Adafruit Motor Shield. In order to avoid too far tilting to the right and to the left, 2 end stoppers and physical limitation are built in.

## Technical characteristics

| Mechanical Device  | Action            | State                |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Side stepper motor | Tilting the tower | +-16° right/left max |
| Top stepper motor  | Arm rotation      | Circular movement    |
