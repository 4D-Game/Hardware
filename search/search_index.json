Each module is controlled by its own Raspberry Pi (with a single Raspberry Pi for every single turret). The Raspberry Pi's are powered by a single 5V power supply unit. For the motor shield a separate 12 V power supply was used. All elements of the game CrazyComet are attached to the base plate. The turrets are placed within a circle, so every player has the same chance of hitting the target. All connection cables are aligned on the bottom of the base plate. A hole to route the tables is provided for every turret. For the ground plane to stand properly three M6 threaded bore holes are provided every 450mm. 3D-Model of the base plate","title":"Overview"},{"location":"components/","text":"Components The following tables contain a list of all components needed to build the CrazyComet Game Electronic components The table below contains list of the electronics components for building the game.

They are used to \"shoot\" the comets. In the current setup six turrets are used. Construction Functionality The model used for implementing the turrets was found on Thingiverse 1 . We chose this model because the design went very well with our initial game idea and the fundamental movements (Horizontal and vertical rotation of the aiming part) were given. As said, the main technical functionality of this Prototype is to rotate horizontal and vertical in order ot give the player a good aiming experience. One is placed below the base of the turret. The other is placed on the right side of the top element. In order to detect if the player hit the comet, a IR-Sensor is used. The model which is used returns a digital signal. The sensitivity can be tuned with a screw on the back of the sensor.Horizontal rotation of the aiming part would be indicated with the help of an RGB NEOPIXEL LED ring. Adapted 3D-Models of turrets Adaptations This model was not configured for our servo motors. Therefore, every part of the model connected to the motor needed to be changed. In addition, the Blaster Model was created. - Base: New configuration of the middle part, adapted to fit our servo motor. - Base_mount: Creating a little motor winding to fit in the base mount. - Servo_bracket: Adapting the servo bracket to fit our servo motor. - Turret_legs: Added holes for mounting the Turret to the Base plate. - Blaster: New Model which held the Laser sensor, In addition, two LEDs are used to display if the player shot (white) and if he hit (green).
